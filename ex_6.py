# exercise 5 : using if with strings
# write a small program (using if) that assigns the name of 2 trees to 2 variables,
# called tree1 and tree2

tree1 = 'big tree'
tree2 = 'little tree'

if tree1 == tree2:
    print('too many trees!')
else:
    print('perfect variety!')

# and 6 : simple condition
# write a small program that assigns the value 5 to one variable,
# called x and the value of 7 called y
# write a check to see if x is greater, lesser or equal to y
# using if/elif/else

x = 5
y = 7

if (x == y):
    print('they\'re equal!')
elif (x > y):
    print('x is larger!')
else:
    print('y is the larger number!')
